# Plotting

Some very basic examples of plot scripts, using different python frameworks.

`WH_FastFullSim.py` produces a selection of plots to compare FullSim and FastSim WH samples.
It uses the RootTools framework to create histograms and plot.

`HiggsTag_FullFast.py` is an example for using the plottery framework, which just creates nice plots (no histogramming).
